## Design decisions

## Development schedule

## Important application notices
- Please refer to the discord documentation at: https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro, for more details on the msgspec classes.
- The documentation in this package aims to be minimal due to the high probability of changing discord documentation on the official site.
- However, documentation will be provided to clarify possible instances of misunderstanding when using this package where neccesary.
- The msgspec classes in this package are used for the purposes of:
    - type validation of JSON data, for example when received from the discord websocket connection or HTTP API endpoints.
    - value validation of instantiated msgspec representation classes, conditional on the fields of the classes and
    implementing the conditional relations defined in the official documentation for the msgspec classes.
    For example,
    In the webhook endpoints, the prescence of the files JSON param field indicates that the attachment field should be non-null.
    - a serializable interface format for another common data format(e.g msgpack)

###### Discord Activity class
- The package directly avoids modelling discord gateway websocket structures. 
- As a result, the Activity msgspec class implementation of the Discord Activity class is excluded from this package.
- If you should decide to use the discord Activity class(e.g in SetActivityArgument class of the RPC discord section), consider writing your own Activity msgspec class. 
- In the RPC section of this module, the SetActivityArgument class uses the missing Activity msgspec class:
  class SetActivityArgument(msgspec.Struct, kw_only=True):
      pid: int  # application's process id
        activity: 'Activity'  # rich presence to assign to the user (limited to Playing, Listening, Watching, or Competing)

###### Snowflake fields
- Snowflake fields in the discord data tables are implemented in msgspec classes as 'str' rather than 'int'. Remember to convert snowflake field values from 'str' to 'int' before using them in your application.
